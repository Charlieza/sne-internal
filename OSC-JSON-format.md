This document describes the standard OSC JSON format. For JSON files in this repository, which are mostly entered by hand or via data donations, our format requirements are less strict than usual, for instance if you forget to set a supernova's name field, our import script is smart enough to do this for you. As JSON is a sparse format, object names that don't follow our default name choices will simply be ignored by the script. In most cases, this is not desirable as you will want your data to be readable by the catalog import script, but it can be useful for adding new objects that may be unique to your dataset, which in the future could be parsed by the catalog. But so long as you are only adding standard data to a supernova, it is best to follow the guidelines set in this document as closely as possible to avoid potential issues.

Each supernova is contained with a single JSON file that contains a single object bearing the supernova's primary name, which when empty represents the minimum readable entry file:

```JSON
{
  "SN1987A":{}
}
```

To comply with the standard, the object should contain a "name" key and an "aliases" array, where the "name" key should be identical to the primary object name. The aliases array should also contain the supernova's name, as well as any other names the supernova is known by:

```JSON
{
  "SN1987A":{
    "name":"SN1987A",
    "aliases":[
      "SN1987A"
    ]
  }
}
```

Sources are extremely important in the OSC, and every single piece of data added to an event JSON file **must have a source attribution**, with the sole exception of the supernova names and aliases. Published data sources are preferred over secondary sources (the OSC falls into a secondary source category), but if the data was collected by a secondary source intermediate to being added to the OSC, these sources should also be attributed in the source list.

Sources of data contain five fields, one of which is optional:

| Field | Value | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :---
`name` | Source name, e.g. "Catchpole et al. 1989" | no
`alias` | Integer unique to this source to be used as an alias | no
`url` | Web address of source | yes
`bibcode` | 19 character NASA ADS bibcode | yes
