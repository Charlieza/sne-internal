List of SNe, with publications within which light curve data is contained (if known). Please help us find this missing data!

Tables that needs to be digitized:
* SN1969L: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971MmSAI..42..163C (Table 6, spectra also available)
* SN1978K: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...416..167R (Table 1)
* A few data points for several more SN sprinkled throughout: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1938ApJ....88..285B
* SN1604A: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1943ApJ....97..119B (Table 4)
* 2012MNRAS.425.1007B: http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/425/2/1007/F1.expansion.html
* PS1-10afx: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...767..162C

Plots that need to be digitized:
* Several SN: http://www.jstor.org/stable/984985?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

This paper contains a ton of reference info for supernovae prior to 1980, look for references marked "l. c." to find publications with light curve data: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979AcC.....8....5F
